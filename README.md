Question-1:

They aked to generate the probabilites of random poison distribution,and plot the histogram for these points for 3 times:
To generate the probailites of random poison distribution I used numpy.random.poison(lam,1000) is will return an array of the probabilites of the 1000 samples.using matplotlib.pyplot I plot those in a graph.

Question-2:

They aked generate the probabilites of random normal distribution,and plot the histogram for these points for 3 times:
To generate the probailites of random poison distribution I used numpy.random.normal(mu,sigma,1000) is will return an array of the probabilites of the 1000 samples.using matplotlib.pyplot I plot those in a graph.

Question-3:
They aksed to geneate the graphs for selecting the 100 random samples from Q-1 ,Q-2 and mean them and plot the graph for 100 times:
To do this using numpy.random.poison(lam,1000) and numpy.random.normal(mu,sigma,1000)  I generated the samples,I created a empty list then using random function I took 100 samples from both poison and naormal then mean them and added to the empty list.Now using that list I ploted the graph.This was repeated for 100 times
